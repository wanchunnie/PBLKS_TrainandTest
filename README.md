# PBLKS-models
This package contains detailed codes about training and implementation of various models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron(MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),  Recurrent Neutral Network (RNN) and Bidirectional RNN (Bi-RNN).

The datas used to train and implement these models are saved in the 'train_data' and 'test_data' folder.

The details training parameters of models are listed in the 'model_parameters.txt'.
  
The codes of models constructed by Kreas was saved in 'Keras' fold.

## Dependencies

The users can install the dependencies by invoking pip install.

```bash
pip install -r requirments.txt
